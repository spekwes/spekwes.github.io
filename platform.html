                    <li>In 2016, the government spent $91 billion on college tuition assistance. $37 billion of this
                        amount went to tuition tax credits that disproportionately helped wealthier families. We plan
                        to relocate some of the funding to public colleges for tuition assistance instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>For families earning less than $75,000 yearly, we will provide those earning below the 40th
                        percentile of every state with free public college opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li>We also plan to expand funding for work-study programs.</li>

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>We believe a carbon-credit system is the best approach in tackling climate change. The
                        carbon-credit system allows companies to have a non-penalized carbon allowance up to however
                        many credits they have. This being said, they can purchase credits from companies willing to
                        trade, or can continue business while paying fees corresponding to their carbon output.
                    </li>
                    <li>The carbon tax, on the other hand, will be detrimental to the US industry as this newly imposed
                        tax will incentivize companies to relocate to other countries.
                    </li>
                    <li>The carbon-credit system not only avoids this issue, but will provide excess money to fund
                        renewable-energy research. We will work towards a healthier environment without compromising
                        American Industry.

                        abortion legalized.

                        means that the curation of information can have an incredible impact on the political process in
                        the United States.

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>Affirmative action is detrimental under the current administration because it is a negative
                        feedback loop. Minority students that get accepted to particular colleges with less preparation
                        for their new environment tend to fall behind very quickly and become increasingly lost as the
                        instructors and other students advance in the course. The performance of minorities is damaged,
                        consequently solidifying the stereotype of minorities being inherently poor students.
                    </li>
                    <li>Colleges currently only use race-based affirmative action for positive public press. With
                        increased diversity statistics due to accepting unprepared minority students, universities
                        subsequently don’t care about the minorities, but they will line their pockets with student
                        debt. The current student debt total in the U.S. has exceeded $1.5 trillion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our administration wants to provide more opportunities for qualified applicants that might be
                        economically challenged, allowing for less pressure on minority students and allowing them to
                        perform better.
