                    <li>The false advertisement of big social media platforms to the American public as platforms rather
                        than publishers hurts American democracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in his April 2018 testimony that his company is
                        “responsible for the content on its platform”. Besides him implying that Facebook is legally
                        responsible for any non-licensed photos and verbal abuse on the network, saying that his network
                        controls its content isn’t really consistent with what is legally a platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>By definition, platform are companies that enable content and distribution of information. If
                        social networks are a platform, then they cannot be liable for the material that is posted on
                        their networks. You can’t sue them for defamation if someone publishes libelous content. They
                        should just provide the platform, not the message.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is fine if Facebook or any other large social media firm wants to be a publisher and hide
                        certain kinds of information or media, but it must advertise itself as such. Having such large
                        public outreach means that the curation of information can have an incredible impact on the
                        political process in the United States

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>The current system is a negative feedback loop. Minority students that get accepted to certain
                        colleges with less preparation for their new environment tend to fall behind very quickly and
                        become increasingly lost as the instructors and the other students advance in the course. That
                        of course damages their actual performance, solidifying the stereotype of minorities being
                        inherently poor students.

                    </li>
                    <li>It’s clear that colleges only use race-based affirmative action for positive public press. Once
                        those minority students are a part of their diversity statistics, they don’t really care for
                        them, rather only for lining their pockets with student debt once they drop out. (The current
                        student debt total in the U.S. has exceeded $1.5 trillion, and millenials make up for a third of
                        that)

                    </li>
                    <li>By providing more opportunities for qualified applicants that might be economically challenged,
                        there’s less of a chance for this to happen. Minority students would be able to enjoy college
                        environments that put less pressure on them and allow them to do better.
